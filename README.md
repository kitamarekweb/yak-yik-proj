Node Package Manager Tips:
1. 
    npm i -S superagent  => this will be put into package.json in "dependencies",
                            and this "dependencies" will get deploy to the serwer,
                            these will go up with the project 
                            
    npm i -D superagent  => this will be put into package.json in "devDependencies",
                            and this "devDependencies" will NOT be deploy to the serwer,
                            these will NOT go up with the project
